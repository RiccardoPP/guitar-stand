# Multiple guitar/bass stand

This is a compact multiple guitar/bass stand with approximate dimensions of 37 x 21.5 x 21 mm.

My version was built using a 20 mm fir board, cut with a Creality Falcon2 Pro (40w) laser machine using parameters of 100 mm/min and 100% power.

Feel free to edit and improve this design.

If you require a ready-to-use product, please consider purchasing the STRICH stand on Amazon (affiliate link!): https://amzn.to/4kolm7j
